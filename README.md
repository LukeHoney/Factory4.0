## :rotating_light: Emergency 
For both safety and productivity reasons, it is crucial for all stakeholders to be aware of whether all the machines in the factory are operational. The Festo AR application provides a solution to this by allowing the user to check if any of the machines have an emergency button pressed. The application displays this information on both the digital twin and the AR view as soon as an emergency occurs. Moreover, the user can verify the connection by simply pressing the "Check Connection" UI button.

## :inbox_tray: Stock Check
Ensuring that all required components are available is crucial for maintaining smooth and efficient production, as component shortages can lead to delays, resulting in lost revenue. The Festo AR Application offers a solution to this problem by enabling users to check the stock levels of front and back covers, as well as chipboards. To do this, the user simply needs to press the "Check Stock" button.
